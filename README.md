# MyReads Project

This is my assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course:
- I completed the required development
- I created the documentation under the folder docs
- I created unit tests using Jest / Enzyme

## Commands

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* run the unit tests with `npm test`
* create the documentation with `npm run jsdoc`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
